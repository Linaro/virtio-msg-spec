# Thanks for proposing a change to the virtio-msg specification

This is not the same as proposing a change to the VirtIO spec. This
repository is intended for preparing the virtio-msg transport
specification before it's submission to the VIRTIO TC.

If your intention was to suggestion to change to the upstream please
propose the change as a patch to the [mailing list](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=virtio#feedback).
